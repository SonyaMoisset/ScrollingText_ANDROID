    <string name="article_text">Quincy Larson was just a \"guy in a suit in an office\" and decided he wanted to learn how to code. So he asked around. He started by picking up a bit of Ruby then found himself skimming through other languages like Scala, Clojure and Go. He learned Emacs then Vim and even the Dvorak keyboard layout. He picked up Linux, dabbled in Lisp and coded in Python while living on the command line for more than half a year. Article: http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard\n\nLike a leaf in a tornado, the advice Quincy received jerked him first one way and then another and then another until he\'d finally taken \"every online course program imaginable\". By the end of it all, despite having ultimately landed a software development job, Quincy:\n\n... was convinced that the seemingly normal programmers I ran into were actually sociopaths who had experienced, then repressed, the trauma of learning to code.\n\nOuch. Does that sound familiar?</string>
